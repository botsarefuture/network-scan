### Roadmap for API and GUI Integration:

1. **Define API Endpoints:**
   - Identify the functions needed for the API version (e.g., getting targets, adding targets, notifying the server).
   - Design clear and RESTful API endpoints for each functionality.

2. **API Implementation:**
   - Develop the API version, implementing the functions defined in step 1.
   - Test the API functions independently to ensure they work as expected.

3. **API Documentation:**
   - Document the API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use the API.

4. **Create API Wrapper Functions:**
   - In the GUI version, create wrapper functions that interact with the API endpoints.
   - Use a library like `requests` to make HTTP requests to the API.

5. **Integrate API Calls in GUI:**
   - Replace the simulated functions in the GUI version with actual calls to the API wrapper functions.
   - Modify the GUI version to handle responses from the API appropriately.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms for API calls in both versions.
   - Ensure meaningful error messages are displayed to the user.

7. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing for both the API and GUI versions.
   - Test the GUI version to ensure it communicates effectively with the API.
   - Check for edge cases and handle them gracefully.

8. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement security measures for both versions, such as input validation and secure communication (e.g., HTTPS for API).
   - Consider user authentication and authorization for API access.

9. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize API calls for performance.
   - Implement caching or asynchronous processing if necessary.

10. **Documentation Update:**
    - Update documentation for the GUI version to reflect changes made for API integration.
    - Include information on how to set up and configure the API.

11. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the API and GUI versions separately or on different servers if needed.
    - Ensure that the API is accessible from the GUI application.

12. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Implement monitoring for both the API and GUI to detect and address issues promptly.
    - Establish a maintenance plan for updates and improvements.

13. **User Education:**
    - If applicable, provide users with information on how to configure and use the integrated system.
    - Offer support and documentation for troubleshooting.

By following this roadmap, you can systematically integrate the API and GUI versions, ensuring a smooth and efficient interaction between the two components. Regular testing and documentation updates are crucial throughout the process.
