### Step 1: Define API Endpoints

**Objective:** Clearly define the functionalities and design RESTful API endpoints for the API version.

1. **Identify Functionalities:**
   - List the key functionalities that the API version needs to support. In your case, this includes getting targets, adding targets, and notifying the server about actions.

2. **Define Target Retrieval Endpoint:**
   - Design an endpoint for retrieving a target from the server. For example:
     - **Endpoint:** `/api/targets/get`
     - **Method:** `GET`
     - **Parameters:** None
     - **Response:** JSON object containing target information (IP, type, port, priority, additional_info).

3. **Define Target Addition Endpoint:**
   - Design an endpoint for adding a target to the server. For example:
     - **Endpoint:** `/api/targets/add`
     - **Method:** `POST`
     - **Parameters:** JSON object with target information (IP, type, port, priority, additional_info).
     - **Response:** JSON object confirming the addition.

4. **Define Notification Endpoint:**
   - Design an endpoint for notifying the server about various events (e.g., credentials found, infected server). For example:
     - **Endpoint:** `/api/notify`
     - **Method:** `POST`
     - **Parameters:** JSON object with event details (target_ip, event_type, event_details).
     - **Response:** JSON object confirming the notification.

5. **Versioning and Authentication:**
   - Decide on an API versioning strategy (e.g., `/v1/` in the URL).
   - Plan how authentication will be handled (e.g., API key, OAuth).

6. **Consider Pagination and Filtering:**
   - If dealing with a large number of targets, consider adding pagination to the retrieval endpoint.
   - Explore options for filtering results based on parameters.

7. **Documentation Draft:**
   - Create a preliminary draft of API documentation that includes endpoint details, expected parameters, and responses.
   - Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for clear and interactive documentation.

8. **Review and Feedback:**
   - Share the proposed API design with team members or stakeholders for feedback.
   - Incorporate suggestions and adjustments as needed.

9. **Finalize API Design:**
   - Based on feedback, finalize the design of the API endpoints.
   - Document any changes made during the review process.

10. **Mock API Endpoints (Optional):**
    - If applicable, consider creating mock endpoints to facilitate initial testing and development of the GUI version.

11. **Define Data Models:**
    - Define the data models for the JSON objects exchanged between the GUI and API.
    - Specify data types, required fields, and any validation rules.

12. **Plan for Extensibility:**
    - Consider how the API can be extended in the future to support additional functionalities.
    - Plan for backward compatibility if modifications are needed.

13. **Legal and Compliance Considerations:**
    - Ensure that the API design complies with legal and privacy requirements.
    - Address any security or data protection concerns.

14. **Document API Constraints:**
    - Clearly document any constraints or limitations of the API, such as rate limiting.

15. **Summary Document:**
    - Create a comprehensive summary document outlining the finalized API design, including endpoints, methods, parameters, and expected responses.

By thoroughly defining the API endpoints, you set a strong foundation for building both the API and GUI versions. This initial planning phase helps ensure that the subsequent development and integration stages proceed smoothly.
