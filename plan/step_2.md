### Step 2: API Implementation

**Objective:** Develop the API version, implementing the functions defined in Step 1.

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a dedicated directory for the API project.
   - Set up a virtual environment for dependency management.

2. **Choose a Framework:**
   - Select a web framework suitable for your project (e.g., Flask, Django for Python).
   - Install the chosen framework within your virtual environment.

3. **Initialize Project:**
   - Use the chosen framework's commands to initialize a new project.
   - Set up the necessary project structure and configurations.

4. **Implement Target Retrieval Endpoint:**
   - Create the endpoint for retrieving a target from the server.
   - Implement the logic to fetch a target from your data source (database, file, etc.).
   - Ensure the response is in the specified JSON format.

5. **Implement Target Addition Endpoint:**
   - Implement the endpoint for adding a target to the server.
   - Write the logic to validate and store the new target information.
   - Return a JSON response confirming the addition.

6. **Implement Notification Endpoint:**
   - Develop the endpoint for receiving notifications.
   - Implement the logic to handle different types of notifications.
   - Store relevant information based on the notification.

7. **Add Versioning and Authentication:**
   - Integrate versioning into your API endpoints.
   - Implement authentication mechanisms based on your chosen strategy.

8. **Handle Pagination and Filtering:**
   - If applicable, implement pagination for the target retrieval endpoint.
   - Add filtering capabilities based on parameters.

9. **Implement Data Models:**
   - Create classes or structures to represent the data models defined in Step 1.
   - Use these models to validate incoming requests and format responses.

10. **Mock Data for Testing:**
    - For initial testing, consider using mock data or a temporary data source.
    - Ensure that the API endpoints can handle various scenarios.

11. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error handling to provide meaningful responses for different error scenarios.
    - Include appropriate HTTP status codes.

12. **Testing:**
    - Conduct unit tests for each endpoint to verify their functionality.
    - Use tools like `unittest` or `pytest` to automate testing.

13. **Documentation Update:**
    - Update the API documentation to reflect the actual implementation.
    - Include details on how to make requests to each endpoint.

14. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement security measures, such as input validation and sanitation.
    - Ensure that sensitive information is handled securely.

15. **Compliance Checks:**
    - Perform checks to ensure the API complies with legal and privacy requirements.
    - Address any security or data protection concerns identified during implementation.

16. **Final Review:**
    - Conduct a thorough review of the implemented API.
    - Verify that all endpoints function as expected and meet the design specifications.

17. **Deploy Staging Version (Optional):**
    - If applicable, deploy a staging version of the API for additional testing.

18. **Client Testing:**
    - Provide the API documentation to the GUI development team.
    - Collaborate with the team to conduct initial tests and address any integration issues.

19. **Bug Fixes and Iterations:**
    - Address any bugs or issues identified during the testing phase.
    - Make iterations based on feedback from the development team.

20. **Prepare for Production:**
    - Configure the API for a production environment.
    - Ensure appropriate scalability and performance optimizations.

21. **Launch API:**
    - Deploy the API to the production environment.
    - Monitor the API for any issues after deployment.

22. **Monitoring Setup:**
    - Set up monitoring tools to track API performance, errors, and usage.
    - Establish alerting mechanisms for critical issues.

23. **Documentation Refinement:**
    - Finalize and refine the API documentation based on any changes made during implementation.
    - Include details on production endpoints and considerations.

24. **User Communication:**
    - Communicate the availability of the API to relevant stakeholders.
    - Provide contact information for support or inquiries.

25. **Post-Launch Support:**
    - Be prepared to address any issues that arise post-launch promptly.
    - Monitor user feedback and make necessary improvements.

By following this plan for API implementation, you ensure that the API version is robust, well-documented, and ready for integration with the GUI version in the next steps.
