### Step 4: Create API Wrapper Functions

**Objective:** In the GUI version, create wrapper functions that interact with the API endpoints.

1. **Identify GUI Components:**
   - Review the GUI version's code and identify sections where interactions with the API are simulated or need modification.

2. **Create API Wrapper Module:**
   - Develop a new module or file specifically for API wrapper functions.
   - Keep the API-related functions separate for clarity.

3. **Import Requests Library:**
   - Ensure that the `requests` library is imported into the GUI code.
   - If not present, install it using `pip install requests`.

4. **Define API Endpoint URLs:**
   - Set up global variables or constants for the base URL of the API and individual endpoint URLs.
   - For example:
     ```python
     BASE_API_URL = "https://api.example.com/v1"
     GET_TARGET_ENDPOINT = "/targets/get"
     ADD_TARGET_ENDPOINT = "/targets/add"
     NOTIFY_ENDPOINT = "/notify"
     ```

5. **Create API Wrapper Functions:**
   - Write wrapper functions for each API endpoint.
   - Use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API.

6. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Include error handling mechanisms within the wrapper functions.
   - Check for HTTP status codes and raise exceptions or handle errors accordingly.

7. **Handle Authentication:**
   - Implement authentication mechanisms within the wrapper functions.
   - Include any required headers or tokens for API access.

8. **Parse JSON Responses:**
   - Parse the JSON responses received from the API.
   - Extract relevant information for further processing in the GUI.

9. **Incorporate Threading or Asynchronous Calls (Optional):**
   - If applicable, consider making API calls asynchronously to avoid blocking the GUI.
   - Explore Python threading or asynchronous libraries.

10. **Testing:**
    - Test each wrapper function independently to ensure it correctly interacts with the API.
    - Simulate various scenarios, including success and error responses.

11. **Logging (Optional):**
    - Add logging statements to the wrapper functions for better debugging and monitoring.
    - Log relevant information such as request details and API responses.

12. **Documentation Update:**
    - Update the GUI version's documentation to reflect the changes made for API integration.
    - Include details on using the API wrapper functions.

13. **Code Review:**
    - Conduct a code review of the API wrapper functions.
    - Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

14. **Collaboration with API Team:**
    - Collaborate with the team responsible for the API to address any integration issues or questions.
    - Ensure alignment between the GUI and API versions.

15. **Integration with GUI Code:**
    - Replace the existing simulated functions in the GUI version with calls to the newly created API wrapper functions.
    - Modify the GUI code to handle API responses appropriately.

16. **Cross-Functional Testing:**
    - Test the integrated GUI and API versions together.
    - Verify that the GUI interacts seamlessly with the API and handles responses correctly.

17. **User Education:**
    - If applicable, provide users with information on how to configure and use the integrated system.
    - Offer support and documentation for troubleshooting.

18. **Bug Fixes and Iterations:**
    - Address any bugs or issues identified during the integration testing.
    - Make iterations based on feedback from testing.

19. **Security Measures:**
    - Double-check that sensitive information, such as API keys, is handled securely in the GUI code.
    - Ensure that the GUI follows security best practices when interacting with the API.

20. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimize API calls for performance within the GUI.
    - Consider implementing caching strategies if applicable.

21. **Final Review:**
    - Conduct a final review of the integrated GUI and API versions.
    - Verify that the functionality works as expected and that the GUI responds appropriately to API changes.

22. **Deployment (Optional):**
    - If the GUI version is a standalone application, deploy the updated version with API integration.
    - Ensure that users have access to the latest version of the application.

23. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Implement monitoring for both the GUI and API to detect and address issues promptly.
    - Establish a maintenance plan for updates and improvements.

By creating API wrapper functions and integrating them into the GUI version, you establish a connection between the two components. This step ensures that the GUI can effectively communicate with the API and leverage its functionalities.
